# Linear algebra

* Single-threaded actors do "naive" additions/multiplications. 

Example: Strassens algorithm
-> service looks at a matrix, determines if
1) it is dense/sparse/triangular/etc
2) it can be cleanly blocked
3) so on :)
-> let's say it cannot be cleanly blocked and it's above some threshold size
-> spawns four new *services* (not computation actors) that do the same on their blocks
